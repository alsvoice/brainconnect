---
BrainConnect is an open-source Python package for acquiring, processing and analysing physiological data with the aim of building Human-Computer and Brain-Computer Interfaces. 

## Modules

It includes 5 modules, each of which manages a different block of a HCI / BCI :
* _Devices_: to manage the integration of various biosignals (EEG, EOG, EMG, fNIRS).
* _Data_: to processing the acquired data (storage and pre-processing, and extraction of features).
* _Models_: Machine Learning algorithms (classifiers and data reduction).
* _Paradigms_: various available paradigms for a HCI / BCI, both in the offline and online versions.
* _GUI_: graphic interface to facilitate the use of the software.
