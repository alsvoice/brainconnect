***
BrainConnect is an open-source Python package for acquiring, processing and analysing physiological data with the aim of building Human-Computer and Brain-Computer Interfaces. 
---
It includes 5 modules, each of which manages a block of a HCI / BCI :

    * Devices: it includes the functions to manage the integration of various acquisition instruments (EEG, EOG, EMG, fNIRS).
    * Data: data processing (storage and preprocessing, and extraction of features).
    * Models: Machine Learning algorithms (classifiers and data reduction).
    * Paradigms: various paradigms of the HCI / BCI are available, both in the offline and online versions.
    * GUI: functions related to the graphic interface to facilitate the use of the software.
